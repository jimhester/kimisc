Description: A collection of useful functions not found anywhere else,
    mainly for programming: Pretty intervals, generalized lagged differences,
    checking containment in an interval, creating a factor where
    the levels maintain the order of appearance, sampling rows from
    a data frame, converting seconds from midnight to and from
    H:M:S format, choosing the first non-NA value, transposing
    lists of lists, returning the name of the file currently
    sourced, smart named lists and vectors, and an alternative
    interface to assign().
