\title{Kirill's Miscellaneous Functions}
\description{
A collection of useful functions not found anywhere else,
mainly for programming: Pretty intervals, generalized lagged
differences, checking containment in an interval, creating a
factor where the levels maintain the order of appearance,
sampling rows from a data frame, converting seconds from
midnight to and from H:M:S format, choosing the first non-NA
value, transposing lists of lists, returning the name of the
file currently sourced, smart named lists and vectors, and an
alternative interface to assign().
